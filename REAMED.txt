RIDDLE FIGHTER 1.0 is a bubble popper-type game.

In single player mode enemy units appear at the top of the game field and move down at varying speed, each containing
a riddle, which may include single letters or simple math problems. When enemy units hit the bottom of the game field
the player looses life points (displayed on the top right corner). Reaching zero life points results in game over.
Solution to riddles can be given using the keyboard and a correct solution will erase enemy units from the game field.
Points (displayed on the top left corner) are awarded for riddles solved. At game over the final score is displayed.

In 2-player mode enemy units contain only up,down,left,right arrows. Players need to hit the right keys to obtain an
enemy unit (player1: using arrow keys; player2: using 4,8,5,6 numpad keys). The first player to hit the right keys
will obtain the enemy unit and also do damage to the other player. Damage will deduct a life point (displayed on each
side of the top of the game field) from the relevant player.The first player to lose all life will lose the game.
The game over message displays the winner.
